Dear Someone,

<br>
<hr>
I don't know why i love her very much. I love playing/hunging around with her knowingly or unknowling and sorry i can't manage do same for you and even i may don't know how to do same with you. I am what I am and sorry for that.
<hr>
I hope you understand the same and you must as you are also acquainted with same. You would easily got answer if you ask yourself deep inside your piristine heart. You may simle thinking of me what a smug irrational champ. And lastly it is what it is.   
<hr>
I would like to apologize here that may i have denied your some requets and forget to ask your whereabouts but thats for a reason. You are way smarter then her as she is so childish that she never comeforth to show her feelings as like yours. I hope you better understand as you know me better then her.
<hr>
Sometimes she is so insane lunatic as i amaze what's going on and often frustate, damn why don't you understand. Also i don't give up so easily, at last she is one who shows me the way and finally i smile ohh i missed some, now here it is as you want.
<hr>
I am unkonwn whether she has same for me or not, but my feelings are never gonna change for her. Though we were unacquainted for quite long, but as the kickstart started the bond is being more relentless.
<hr>
Yours,
<br>
Suman
